# Frontend for the beademingstoestel (ventilator) project 

The folder [httpServer](httpServer) contains both the nodeJS project and the nextjs UI projects that together make up the interface to control and monitor the device. This interface interacts with the device via the python daemon that can be also found in this organisation.

If you only want to install this interface using the docker images we refer you to the frontend_installer project instead.

The project is licensed under the GPL v3 license
